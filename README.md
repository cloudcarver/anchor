# ⚓ Anchor

English | [中文](README.zh.md)

Build serverless, reliable apps at lightspeed ⚡ — with confidence 🛡️.

### Highlights ✨

- **YAML-first, codegen-backed**: Define HTTP and task schemas in YAML; Anchor generates strongly-typed interfaces so missing implementations fail at compile time, not in prod.
- **Async tasks you can trust**: At-least-once delivery, automatic retries, and cron scheduling out of the box.
- **Transaction-safe flows**: A `WithTx` pattern ensures hooks always run and side effects are consistent.
- **Typed database layer**: Powered by `sqlc` for safe, fast queries.
- **Fast HTTP server**: Built on Fiber for performance and ergonomics.
- **AuthN/Z built-in**: Macaroons-based authentication and authorization.
- **Pluggable architecture**: First-class plugin system for clean modularity.
- **Ergonomic DI**: Wire-based dependency injection keeps code testable and explicit.

### Why Anchor? (The problem it solves) 🤔

- **Glue-code fatigue**: Many teams stitch HTTP, DB, tasks, DI, and auth by hand, leaving implicit contracts and runtime surprises. Anchor makes those contracts explicit and generated.
- **Background jobs are hard**: Idempotency, retries, and delivery guarantees are non-trivial. Anchor ships a task engine with at-least-once semantics and cron.
- **Consistency across boundaries**: Keep handlers, tasks, and hooks transactional using `WithTx` so invariants hold.
- **Confidence and testability**: Every generated interface is mockable; behavior is easy to test.

### Key advantages 🏆

- **Compile-time confidence**: Schema → interfaces → concrete implementations you cannot forget to write.
- **Productivity**: `anchor init` + `anchor gen` reduces boilerplate and wiring.
- **Extensibility**: Clean plugin boundaries and event-driven architecture.
- **Predictability**: Singletons for core services, DI for clarity, and well-defined lifecycles.

## Quick start 🚀

```bash
go install github.com/cloudcarver/anchor/cmd/anchor@latest
anchor init . github.com/my/app
anchor gen
```

## One‑minute tour 🧭

1) Define an endpoint (OpenAPI YAML) 🧩

```yaml
paths:
  /api/v1/counter:
    get:
      operationId: getCounter
```

2) Define a task ⏱️

```yaml
tasks:
  incrementCounter:
    description: Increment the counter value
    cron: "*/1 * * * *"
```

3) Generate and implement 🛠️

```bash
anchor gen
```

```go
func (h *Handler) GetCounter(c *fiber.Ctx) error {
  return c.JSON(apigen.Counter{Count: 0})
}
```
